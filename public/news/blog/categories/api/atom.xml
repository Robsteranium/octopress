    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year the <a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/summit-highlights/">Future Everything conference</a> focussed on three core themes: creative code, future cities, and the data society. In one of the final sessions (<a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/sessions/the-bespoke-smart-city/">The Bespoke Smart City</a>), keynote speaker Anthony Townsend set a challenge to the audience. He asked whether &lsquo;smart&rsquo; techniques were transferable from city to city, given that each city has it&rsquo;s own unique context. This article is a response to that question: I believe that there exists a set of processes and standards that may be replicated from place to place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/routes_to_future.jpg"></p>

<p>One of the resounding messages from the conference was that smart cities are really a product of smart citizens. This is an idea close to my heart. I have written before about the need for <a href="{news/2009-02-13-people-managed-places">people-managed places</a>.</p>

<p>The top-down model of the smart city being advocated by technology corporations begins with a peculiar premise: that the city can be controlled. The engineering metaphor of a <a href="http://www.siemens.com/innovation/apps/pof_microsite/_pof-spring-2011/_html_en/city-cockpit.html">&lsquo;smart city cockpit&rsquo;</a> provides an illusion of centralised power but totalitarian control doesn&rsquo;t make people smart.</p>

<p>In reality cities are organic and messy. To make them smart we need to share information that citizens can use, not to capture data about people without their consent.</p>

<p>There exists a standard for sharing information openly so that everyone can use it: it&rsquo;s called the internet. We do not need proprietorial technology platforms or <a href="http://www.raptorsme.com/home/default.asp?page=welcome">urban operating systems</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of good projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Shared space</em> is a design principle which seeks to minimise the demarcations and barriers between pedestrian and vehicle traffice. The idea is that these barriers create risk compensation whereby road users act with less caution because the perceive a lower degree of risk. From a smart-citzens perspective, the urban planner has done their thinking for them. The shared space approach considers people to be intelligent and, if the possibility of danger is present, then people will be more cautious.</li>
<li><em>Xively</em> (previously Pachube/ Cosm) is a <a href="https://xively.co">platform for connecting and sharing data to/ from the internet of things</a>. Essentially this is an infrastructure for the physical city to talk to it&rsquo;s citizens.</li>
<li><em>Open 311</em> is a <a href="http://open311.org/">collaborative model and open standard for civic issue tracking</a>. It&rsquo;s a protocol for reporting problems to your local council. As a standard, economies of scale can be reached and the tools built around the platform may be shared from place to place.</li>
<li><em>Open Trip Planner</em> is a <a href="http://opentripplanner.com/">open source platform for multi-modal trip and itineray planning and analysis</a>. It is based upon Open Street Map and the (open) General Transit Feed Specification. It offers route planning, real time updates of delays/ disruptions, and analysis of coverage/ travel times etc.</li>
<li><em>The City Service Development Kit</em> is a <a href="http://www.citysdk.eu/">toolkit for the development of digital services in cities</a>. The tools build on top of Open Street Map and Open 311 to provide a Linked Open Data API.</li>
</ul>


<p>The common theme here is that these projects adopt open standards which allow us to learn from others and add our efforts to a common purpose. The tools themselves build around common standards and so may be customised to suit the specific context of each city (i.e. in terms of it&rsquo;s open street map layout).</p>

    <id>http://infonomics.ltd.uk/news/blog/2013/03/20/open-data-sources-beyond-the-public-sector</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second in a pair of posts designed to provide a primer on sources of open data. This post focuses on non-public sector sources, the previous one looked at <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/18/public-sector-information-whats-available-and-where-you-can-find-it/">where to go for open government data</a>.</p>

<h2>The Social Web</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/circles-bird.png"></p>

<p>As you might expect, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of data being generated across social networking platforms. These businesses thrive on having porous walls (from a data perspective at least). It&rsquo;s little surprise then that they all come with a suite of developer tools to help you build functionality into their offering. This approach wouldn&rsquo;t be considered by all to constitute openness (and indeed some are <a href="http://www.fsf.org/facebook">completely resistant to the prospect of Facebook owning their identity</a>) but it is worth mentioning as these resources contain a wealth of information. Typically permission must be given by a user for you to access their perspective on the social network using protocols such as open auth</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter&rsquo;s Developer APIs</a> provide programmatic access to what they call &lsquo;platform objects&rsquo;: Tweets, Users, Entities (#hashtags, media, urls, and @mentions), and Places.</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com">Facebook for Developers</a> includes the Graph API for reading from and writing to Facebook platform: Users, Pages, Groups, Photos, Videos, and the actions between objects. They&rsquo;ve even got their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/technical-guides/fql/">own query language</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">Linked-in APIs</a> for People, Groups, Companies, and Jobs.</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/+/">The Google+ Platform</a> for People, Activities, Comments and Moments</li>
</ul>


<h2>Open Corporates</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/mapping-tesco.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> has a straightforward (though big) ambition: to have a URL for every company in the world. The project combines data collected from official registries (such as Companies House in the UK) with crowd-sourced data (e.g. from unparseable filings etc). The <a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/">blog</a> reveals some of the fascinating analyses that are possible (such as <a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/2012/12/17/guest-post-data-sketching-with-the-opencorporates-api/">this network graph of directors and companies</a>) and issues that exist in this area (<a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/2012/07/24/are-duns-numbers-the-crack-cocaine-of-id-systems-and-is-the-uk-the-latest-addict/">are DUNS numbers the crack cocaine of business identification?</a>).</p>

<h2>Princeton Wordnet</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Princeton WordNet</a> is a lexical database of English &ndash; a catalogue of words.
<blockquote><p>Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet&rsquo;s structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.</p></blockquote>
If you&rsquo;re interested in text analysis then I highly recommend that you check out <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">Gate</a> which of course has a Wordnet plugin.</p>

<h2>OPTA MCFC-Analytics</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/Opta.png"></p>

<p>Opta &ndash; a sports data company &ndash; has released data as part of the MCFC-Analytics project. There are two datasets:
&ndash; The &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; Dataset which has an entry for every player&rsquo;s appearance in each match (10,370 in total) from the 2011-12 Premier League Season. The 185 fields cover a handful of contextual details (name of player and team etc) and counts for all of the &ldquo;on ball&rdquo; events in some detail (e.g. &ldquo;Total Successful Passes Excl Crosses Corners&rdquo;). The data is provided in csv.
&ndash; The &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; data provides a time and space (x, y, and z!) coded feed of events, codified by type. The initial set of open data covers only Manchester City players although more is promised if you can demonstrate some interesting developments&hellip;</p>

<h2>DBpedia</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/dbpedia_logo.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>&hellip;
<blockquote><p>&hellip;is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to make sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope this will make it easier for the amazing amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in new and interesting ways, and that it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, linking, and improving the encyclopedia itself.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Freebase</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/freebase-logo.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://freebase.org/">Freebase</a> is a free, open knowledge graph covering 37 million topics, 2000 types, and 30,000 properties. Topics (e.g. <a href="http://www.freebase.com/m/04lg6">Leonardo da Vinci</a>) can have types (e.g. Visual Artists) and types contain properties (e.g. his <a href="http://www.freebase.com/query?autorun=1&amp;q=%5B%7B%22id%22:%22/m/04lg6%22,%22name%22:null,%22/visual_art/visual_artist/artworks%22:%5B%5D%7D%5D">artworks</a>).</p>

<p>Hopefully that gives you a flavour of what is out there. I&rsquo;d welcome any additional suggestions in the comments&hellip;</p>

This post focuses on open government data and the next focusses on <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/20/open-data-sources-beyond-the-public-sector">open data beyond the public sector</a>.</p>

<p>This post was prepared as part of my contribution to the <a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/workshops-fringe-events/business-of-open-data-workshop/">Business of Open Data Workshop</a>. This workshop is the first in a series organised by <a href="http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/">Open Data Manchester</a> and <a href="http://futureeverything.org">Future Everything</a>.</p>

<p>To understand why public sector information is the main source of open data you may wish to read about the <a href="/news/blog/2012/10/25/the-economics-of-open-data">economics of open data</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Who is publishing Public Sector Information &ndash; Where can I find it?</h2>

<h3>data.gov.uk</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/dgu-header.png">
In 2009 <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a> was established to provide a central catalogue of public sector information, covering over 9,000 sources (as I write this). It provides meta data, that is, it acts an index of other data rather than a respository itself. The site is built on the <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> platform. It provides a <a href="http://data.gov.uk/sparql">SPARQL endpoint</a> for a <a href="http://data.gov.uk/linked-data/who-is-doing-what">variety of Linked Open Data resources</a>.
In theory, this site should cover most of what is available from Government. Although in the past, the coverage has been patchy in parts and duplicated in others, this has largely been resolved over the past few years. The main problem with data.gov.uk is that it&rsquo;s sometimes best to go direct to the horses' mouth particularly when what you&rsquo;re interested in is a delivery API, not metadata discovery. As such I&rsquo;ll go into a little more detail about the places you&rsquo;ll usually find yourself after you&rsquo;ve explored data.gov.uk.</p>

<h3>The Office of National Statistics</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/post_images/s300_NS_logo.jpg"></p>

<p>The Office for National Statistics is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority. The authority is a dedicated non-ministerial government department with responsibility for assessing <em>Official statistics</em> (i.e. &ldquo;those produced by a government department or persons acting on behalf of the crown&rdquo;) against it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/">Code of Practice</a> to ensure that only compliant publications are designated <em>National Statistics</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk">ONS</a> has long been providing data as both <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html">datasets</a> and <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/index.html">published reports</a> (books, articles, bulletins) that include some narrative and interpretation. The most recent incarnation of the ONS site has convenient filters for discovering what available by theme, release date (including <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/release-calendar/index.html">forthcoming releases</a>), and geographic scope and precision (i.e. where is covers and with what breakdowns). While it&rsquo;s naturally tempting to rush to the raw data you should also bear in mind that the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/index.html">methodological guidance</a> is very important &ndash; there&rsquo;s many a time this has either saved me making a mistake in interpretation (fixed-capital investment figures used to be apportioned by jobs and so were no more informative for making regional comparisons) or suggested an alternate &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; dataset that offered new insights (e.g. multiple approaches to measuring Gross Value Added).</p>

<p>Of particular note are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ONS&rsquo;s site for labour market statistics &ndash; <a href="http://www.nomisweb.co.uk">nomis</a> &ndash; they have a <a href="http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help">RESTful API</a> which is compliant with the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SMDX) ISO standard. The API offers both discovery and delivery services, URI resolution, and HTML, XML, json, and csv response formats.</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/">Neighbourhood Statistics Exchange (NeSS)</a> &ndash; with their <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Info.do?page=nde.htm">Neighbourhood Data Exchange (NDE) API</a>, version 2 of which is now RESTful (I&rsquo;ve got some ruby bindings knocking around somewhere if you really want to use the SOAP interface instead).</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/what-we-do/programmes---projects/enhancing-access-to-ons-data/ons-api/index.html">forthcoming ONS API</a> which will operate under a similar principle and is designed with data from the 2011 Census in mind.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Central Government Departments</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/govuk-crest.png">
As part of their daily work and obligations for reporting, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">Central Government Departments</a> produce great volumes of data that is publically available. This departments have gradually be brought out from a heterogenous collection of sites operating under a department.gov.uk sub domain to a consistent www.gov.uk/department arrangement. This has made it much easier to search across Government for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?publication_filter_option=statistics">statistics</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?publication_filter_option=research-and-analysis">research and analysis</a>. Indeed a convenient <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets">index of statistical data sets</a> is provided.</p>

<h3>data.gov.*</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/post_images/datagm-beta.png">
There is also a plethora of other PSI datastores from <a href="http://www.datagm.org.uk/">Manchester</a> to <a href="http://data.gov.md/">Moldova</a> and, indeed, <a href="http://datacatalogs.org">all over the world</a>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s available? The Big Names in PSI</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/oslogo.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>For transport, the main data sets are the <a href="">National Public Transport Access Nodes (NapTAN)</a>, which unique identifies public transport access points, and the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptdr">National Public Transport Data Repository</a>, which provides a snapshot of every GB journey in ATCO-CIF and TransXChange formats. Historically, the NPTDR has been taken annually in October but it is now being provided weekly as the <a href="http://traveline.info/tnds.html">Traveline National Dataset</a> (requires registration for FTP access).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/index-of-multiple-deprivation">Indicies of Multiple Deprivation</a> &ndash; which ranks English neighbourhoods (or Lower-layer Super Output Areas &ndash; LSOAs) according to seven dimensions of deprivation. The IMD is often used as a means of allocating resources by need. NB: the publication is irregularly timed and has (historically at least) been subject to methodological changes between years making it difficult to use this dataset for trend analysis. It does, however, provide an incredible level of geographic precision.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins">Combined Online Information System (COINS)</a> &ndash; which is basically the governments central accounts, all 4.3Gb of them!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/postcode-directories/-nspp-/index.html">ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup</a> &ndash; which provides a lookup for transforming postcodes into other geographic terms including statistical areas (e.g. LSOAs) and geocodes (i.e. Latitude-Longitude/ Northings-Eastings).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-opendata.html">Ordnance Survey Open Data</a> including the &lsquo;tiles&rsquo; of the map (raster), government administrative boundaries (vector ESRI shapefiles), code-points (a csv of postcode coordinates etc), and gazetteers of place and road names.</li>
<li><a href="http://legislation.gov.uk">Legislation.gov.uk</a> publishes all UK legislation in both the original enacted form and with revisions that are made over time. The platform is managed by the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">The National Archives</a> and provides Linked Data access (try adding /data.xml to the end of a URI).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in more of the top datasets you might like to peruse <a href="http://data.gov.uk/data/site-usage/dataset">data.gov.uk&rsquo;s own list of popular datasets</a> or read on to <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/20/open-data-sources-beyond-the-public-sector">find out about what&rsquo;s available outside of the public sector</a>.</p>
