    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year the <a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/summit-highlights/">Future Everything conference</a> focussed on three core themes: creative code, future cities, and the data society. In one of the final sessions (<a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/sessions/the-bespoke-smart-city/">The Bespoke Smart City</a>), keynote speaker Anthony Townsend set a challenge to the audience. He asked whether &lsquo;smart&rsquo; techniques were transferable from city to city, given that each city has it&rsquo;s own unique context. This article is a response to that question: I believe that there exists a set of processes and standards that may be replicated from place to place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/routes_to_future.jpg"></p>

<p>One of the resounding messages from the conference was that smart cities are really a product of smart citizens. This is an idea close to my heart. I have written before about the need for <a href="{news/2009-02-13-people-managed-places">people-managed places</a>.</p>

<p>The top-down model of the smart city being advocated by technology corporations begins with a peculiar premise: that the city can be controlled. The engineering metaphor of a <a href="http://www.siemens.com/innovation/apps/pof_microsite/_pof-spring-2011/_html_en/city-cockpit.html">&lsquo;smart city cockpit&rsquo;</a> provides an illusion of centralised power but totalitarian control doesn&rsquo;t make people smart.</p>

<p>In reality cities are organic and messy. To make them smart we need to share information that citizens can use, not to capture data about people without their consent.</p>

<p>There exists a standard for sharing information openly so that everyone can use it: it&rsquo;s called the internet. We do not need proprietorial technology platforms or <a href="http://www.raptorsme.com/home/default.asp?page=welcome">urban operating systems</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of good projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Shared space</em> is a design principle which seeks to minimise the demarcations and barriers between pedestrian and vehicle traffice. The idea is that these barriers create risk compensation whereby road users act with less caution because the perceive a lower degree of risk. From a smart-citzens perspective, the urban planner has done their thinking for them. The shared space approach considers people to be intelligent and, if the possibility of danger is present, then people will be more cautious.</li>
<li><em>Xively</em> (previously Pachube/ Cosm) is a <a href="https://xively.co">platform for connecting and sharing data to/ from the internet of things</a>. Essentially this is an infrastructure for the physical city to talk to it&rsquo;s citizens.</li>
<li><em>Open 311</em> is a <a href="http://open311.org/">collaborative model and open standard for civic issue tracking</a>. It&rsquo;s a protocol for reporting problems to your local council. As a standard, economies of scale can be reached and the tools built around the platform may be shared from place to place.</li>
<li><em>Open Trip Planner</em> is a <a href="http://opentripplanner.com/">open source platform for multi-modal trip and itineray planning and analysis</a>. It is based upon Open Street Map and the (open) General Transit Feed Specification. It offers route planning, real time updates of delays/ disruptions, and analysis of coverage/ travel times etc.</li>
<li><em>The City Service Development Kit</em> is a <a href="http://www.citysdk.eu/">toolkit for the development of digital services in cities</a>. The tools build on top of Open Street Map and Open 311 to provide a Linked Open Data API.</li>
</ul>


<p>The common theme here is that these projects adopt open standards which allow us to learn from others and add our efforts to a common purpose. The tools themselves build around common standards and so may be customised to suit the specific context of each city (i.e. in terms of it&rsquo;s open street map layout).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second in a pair of posts designed to provide a primer on sources of open data. This post focuses on non-public sector sources, the previous one looked at <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/18/public-sector-information-whats-available-and-where-you-can-find-it/">where to go for open government data</a>.</p>

<h2>The Social Web</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/circles-bird.png"></p>

<p>As you might expect, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of data being generated across social networking platforms. These businesses thrive on having porous walls (from a data perspective at least). It&rsquo;s little surprise then that they all come with a suite of developer tools to help you build functionality into their offering. This approach wouldn&rsquo;t be considered by all to constitute openness (and indeed some are <a href="http://www.fsf.org/facebook">completely resistant to the prospect of Facebook owning their identity</a>) but it is worth mentioning as these resources contain a wealth of information. Typically permission must be given by a user for you to access their perspective on the social network using protocols such as open auth</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter&rsquo;s Developer APIs</a> provide programmatic access to what they call &lsquo;platform objects&rsquo;: Tweets, Users, Entities (#hashtags, media, urls, and @mentions), and Places.</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com">Facebook for Developers</a> includes the Graph API for reading from and writing to Facebook platform: Users, Pages, Groups, Photos, Videos, and the actions between objects. They&rsquo;ve even got their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/technical-guides/fql/">own query language</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">Linked-in APIs</a> for People, Groups, Companies, and Jobs.</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/+/">The Google+ Platform</a> for People, Activities, Comments and Moments</li>
</ul>


<h2>Open Corporates</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/mapping-tesco.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> has a straightforward (though big) ambition: to have a URL for every company in the world. The project combines data collected from official registries (such as Companies House in the UK) with crowd-sourced data (e.g. from unparseable filings etc). The <a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/">blog</a> reveals some of the fascinating analyses that are possible (such as <a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/2012/12/17/guest-post-data-sketching-with-the-opencorporates-api/">this network graph of directors and companies</a>) and issues that exist in this area (<a href="http://blog.opencorporates.com/2012/07/24/are-duns-numbers-the-crack-cocaine-of-id-systems-and-is-the-uk-the-latest-addict/">are DUNS numbers the crack cocaine of business identification?</a>).</p>

<h2>Princeton Wordnet</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Princeton WordNet</a> is a lexical database of English &ndash; a catalogue of words.
<blockquote><p>Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet&rsquo;s structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.</p></blockquote>
If you&rsquo;re interested in text analysis then I highly recommend that you check out <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">Gate</a> which of course has a Wordnet plugin.</p>

<h2>OPTA MCFC-Analytics</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/Opta.png"></p>

<p>Opta &ndash; a sports data company &ndash; has released data as part of the MCFC-Analytics project. There are two datasets:
&ndash; The &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; Dataset which has an entry for every player&rsquo;s appearance in each match (10,370 in total) from the 2011-12 Premier League Season. The 185 fields cover a handful of contextual details (name of player and team etc) and counts for all of the &ldquo;on ball&rdquo; events in some detail (e.g. &ldquo;Total Successful Passes Excl Crosses Corners&rdquo;). The data is provided in csv.
&ndash; The &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; data provides a time and space (x, y, and z!) coded feed of events, codified by type. The initial set of open data covers only Manchester City players although more is promised if you can demonstrate some interesting developments&hellip;</p>

<h2>DBpedia</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/dbpedia_logo.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>&hellip;
<blockquote><p>&hellip;is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to make sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope this will make it easier for the amazing amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in new and interesting ways, and that it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, linking, and improving the encyclopedia itself.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Freebase</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/freebase-logo.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://freebase.org/">Freebase</a> is a free, open knowledge graph covering 37 million topics, 2000 types, and 30,000 properties. Topics (e.g. <a href="http://www.freebase.com/m/04lg6">Leonardo da Vinci</a>) can have types (e.g. Visual Artists) and types contain properties (e.g. his <a href="http://www.freebase.com/query?autorun=1&amp;q=%5B%7B%22id%22:%22/m/04lg6%22,%22name%22:null,%22/visual_art/visual_artist/artworks%22:%5B%5D%7D%5D">artworks</a>).</p>

<p>Hopefully that gives you a flavour of what is out there. I&rsquo;d welcome any additional suggestions in the comments&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first in a pair of posts designed to provide a primer on sources of open data. This post focuses on open government data and the next focusses on <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/20/open-data-sources-beyond-the-public-sector">open data beyond the public sector</a>.</p>

<p>This post was prepared as part of my contribution to the <a href="http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/workshops-fringe-events/business-of-open-data-workshop/">Business of Open Data Workshop</a>. This workshop is the first in a series organised by <a href="http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/">Open Data Manchester</a> and <a href="http://futureeverything.org">Future Everything</a>.</p>

<p>To understand why public sector information is the main source of open data you may wish to read about the <a href="/news/blog/2012/10/25/the-economics-of-open-data">economics of open data</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Who is publishing Public Sector Information &ndash; Where can I find it?</h2>

<h3>data.gov.uk</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/dgu-header.png">
In 2009 <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a> was established to provide a central catalogue of public sector information, covering over 9,000 sources (as I write this). It provides meta data, that is, it acts an index of other data rather than a respository itself. The site is built on the <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> platform. It provides a <a href="http://data.gov.uk/sparql">SPARQL endpoint</a> for a <a href="http://data.gov.uk/linked-data/who-is-doing-what">variety of Linked Open Data resources</a>.
In theory, this site should cover most of what is available from Government. Although in the past, the coverage has been patchy in parts and duplicated in others, this has largely been resolved over the past few years. The main problem with data.gov.uk is that it&rsquo;s sometimes best to go direct to the horses' mouth particularly when what you&rsquo;re interested in is a delivery API, not metadata discovery. As such I&rsquo;ll go into a little more detail about the places you&rsquo;ll usually find yourself after you&rsquo;ve explored data.gov.uk.</p>

<h3>The Office of National Statistics</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/post_images/s300_NS_logo.jpg"></p>

<p>The Office for National Statistics is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority. The authority is a dedicated non-ministerial government department with responsibility for assessing <em>Official statistics</em> (i.e. &ldquo;those produced by a government department or persons acting on behalf of the crown&rdquo;) against it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/">Code of Practice</a> to ensure that only compliant publications are designated <em>National Statistics</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk">ONS</a> has long been providing data as both <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html">datasets</a> and <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/index.html">published reports</a> (books, articles, bulletins) that include some narrative and interpretation. The most recent incarnation of the ONS site has convenient filters for discovering what available by theme, release date (including <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/release-calendar/index.html">forthcoming releases</a>), and geographic scope and precision (i.e. where is covers and with what breakdowns). While it&rsquo;s naturally tempting to rush to the raw data you should also bear in mind that the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/index.html">methodological guidance</a> is very important &ndash; there&rsquo;s many a time this has either saved me making a mistake in interpretation (fixed-capital investment figures used to be apportioned by jobs and so were no more informative for making regional comparisons) or suggested an alternate &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; dataset that offered new insights (e.g. multiple approaches to measuring Gross Value Added).</p>

<p>Of particular note are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ONS&rsquo;s site for labour market statistics &ndash; <a href="http://www.nomisweb.co.uk">nomis</a> &ndash; they have a <a href="http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help">RESTful API</a> which is compliant with the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SMDX) ISO standard. The API offers both discovery and delivery services, URI resolution, and HTML, XML, json, and csv response formats.</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/">Neighbourhood Statistics Exchange (NeSS)</a> &ndash; with their <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Info.do?page=nde.htm">Neighbourhood Data Exchange (NDE) API</a>, version 2 of which is now RESTful (I&rsquo;ve got some ruby bindings knocking around somewhere if you really want to use the SOAP interface instead).</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/what-we-do/programmes---projects/enhancing-access-to-ons-data/ons-api/index.html">forthcoming ONS API</a> which will operate under a similar principle and is designed with data from the 2011 Census in mind.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Central Government Departments</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/govuk-crest.png">
As part of their daily work and obligations for reporting, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">Central Government Departments</a> produce great volumes of data that is publically available. This departments have gradually be brought out from a heterogenous collection of sites operating under a department.gov.uk sub domain to a consistent www.gov.uk/department arrangement. This has made it much easier to search across Government for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?publication_filter_option=statistics">statistics</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?publication_filter_option=research-and-analysis">research and analysis</a>. Indeed a convenient <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets">index of statistical data sets</a> is provided.</p>

<h3>data.gov.*</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/post_images/datagm-beta.png">
There is also a plethora of other PSI datastores from <a href="http://www.datagm.org.uk/">Manchester</a> to <a href="http://data.gov.md/">Moldova</a> and, indeed, <a href="http://datacatalogs.org">all over the world</a>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s available? The Big Names in PSI</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/oslogo.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>For transport, the main data sets are the <a href="">National Public Transport Access Nodes (NapTAN)</a>, which unique identifies public transport access points, and the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptdr">National Public Transport Data Repository</a>, which provides a snapshot of every GB journey in ATCO-CIF and TransXChange formats. Historically, the NPTDR has been taken annually in October but it is now being provided weekly as the <a href="http://traveline.info/tnds.html">Traveline National Dataset</a> (requires registration for FTP access).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/index-of-multiple-deprivation">Indicies of Multiple Deprivation</a> &ndash; which ranks English neighbourhoods (or Lower-layer Super Output Areas &ndash; LSOAs) according to seven dimensions of deprivation. The IMD is often used as a means of allocating resources by need. NB: the publication is irregularly timed and has (historically at least) been subject to methodological changes between years making it difficult to use this dataset for trend analysis. It does, however, provide an incredible level of geographic precision.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins">Combined Online Information System (COINS)</a> &ndash; which is basically the governments central accounts, all 4.3Gb of them!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/postcode-directories/-nspp-/index.html">ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup</a> &ndash; which provides a lookup for transforming postcodes into other geographic terms including statistical areas (e.g. LSOAs) and geocodes (i.e. Latitude-Longitude/ Northings-Eastings).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-opendata.html">Ordnance Survey Open Data</a> including the &lsquo;tiles&rsquo; of the map (raster), government administrative boundaries (vector ESRI shapefiles), code-points (a csv of postcode coordinates etc), and gazetteers of place and road names.</li>
<li><a href="http://legislation.gov.uk">Legislation.gov.uk</a> publishes all UK legislation in both the original enacted form and with revisions that are made over time. The platform is managed by the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">The National Archives</a> and provides Linked Data access (try adding /data.xml to the end of a URI).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in more of the top datasets you might like to peruse <a href="http://data.gov.uk/data/site-usage/dataset">data.gov.uk&rsquo;s own list of popular datasets</a> or read on to <a href="/news/blog/2013/03/20/open-data-sources-beyond-the-public-sector">find out about what&rsquo;s available outside of the public sector</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-01T19:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://infonomics.ltd.uk/news/blog/2013/03/01/open-data-business-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data doesn&rsquo;t make for a good tradable commodity, as discussed in a previous post on the <a href="/blog/2012/10/25/the-economics-of-open-data">Economics of Open Data</a>. Because of these market failures, there&rsquo;s a strong business case for the public sector to open data.
But what about commercial business models for open data? This post explains why it&rsquo;s not just the public sector who ought to pay attention to this opportunity.
The post is split into three topics: opening data that you own (why data assets are more valuable to you open), using open data (how to exploit your or someone else&rsquo;s open data) and commercial models (how to get paid in the process).</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Opening your data</h2>

<p>Why should you open your data? Here are a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network effects</li>
<li>Risk mitigation</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Attention</li>
</ul>


<h3>Network effects &ndash; Open is more exploitable</h3>

<p>There is a much greater potential for exploting data where more people have access. As a result your data will have greater value when it is open (to see how see below). Although you may have to share some of the pie with others, the overall pie (and so potentially your slice too) will be bigger.
This is particularly obvious for businesses who have ambitions for their data that are beyond their reach. It&rsquo;s clear that small businesses may not be able to afford a dedicated resource for data manipulation or scientific analysis. It&rsquo;s also true of larger organisations where the analysis is particularly complex and requires the skills of a specialist.
The notion of a network-effect actually goes a step further to argue that it&rsquo;s impossible for any individual business to realise the full potential of their data internally. The data has value for each person that uses it, and in turn each use increases the value of the data. This is because data doesn&rsquo;t hold a value <em>per se</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s value is only realised when data is interpreted with context as information (i.e. when a datum is combined with another datum). If the openness is reciprocal (share-alike) then your data will increase in value as it is shared and linked with other sources. You may even reasonably expect to have your data corrected, cleaned, and maintained (reducing the cost of ownership). There is also the possiblity of other businesses being able to extract value with niche customisations that you don&rsquo;t have the interest (let alone the capacity or knowledge) to consider.
It should be apparent that this benefit is not guaranteed in all situations. If the pie doesn&rsquo;t get any bigger then there may be little to gain from sharing it. The likelihood is that it may be very hard to predict all possible avenues for exploiting your data. Further it&rsquo;s not certain, therefore that keeping data closed a precaution is prudent &ndash; it may turn out to be short-sighted&hellip;</p>

<h3>Risk mitigation &ndash; Open it or else</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t open it, your competitors will.
The value of information depends upon it revealing something novel. Since there are usually a variety of ways of answering a given question it&rsquo;s likely that your data is not entirely unique (i.e. for every purpose, and every user). As a result you stand to be undermined by a competitor who is willing to offer alternative (although not necessarily completely substitutable) data at a lower price. Economic theory suggests that, in competitive markets, the price will equal the marginal cost of supply. Since the marginal cost of supplying data is effectively 0 (or at least very low), you may well find yourself undercut by an open data provider. You are only insulated from this risk to the extent that alternative sources are not perfect substitutes for your data from the perspective of your customers and markets.
Again, this risk is not certain. If you have the sole provider of a data source for which there are no direct substitutes then the probability of being undercut is lower. By exploiting this monopolistic position, however, you leave tremendous incentives for others to find imaginative alternatives to your offering. It may turn out that you&rsquo;re not as unique as you&rsquo;d assumed. Indeed there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll sustain the position of sole provider. Changing technology means that markets that were once protected by barriers to entry are now open to competition. If you are to operate an open data business model, however, and focus on a complementary service, then you are much more likely to cement your position as the default provider and retain your standing in the market&hellip;</p>

<h3>Reputation &ndash; Open is credible</h3>

<p>Opening data is a powerful means of being transparent. That transparency will make your propositions credibile by sending the signal that you have nothing to hide.
As has been particularly obvious in the food industry of late (for historians reading this blog in the next millenium we&rsquo;re in the middle of a crisis about eating horse meat that was advertised as beef), the complexity of global supply chains bring risks because provenance is hard to establish. Open data presents a solution to this problem.
This has to be genuine. Releasing data under the pretense of openness and at the same time making it difficult for anyone to interpret the data will be recognised as a cynical gesture.</p>

<h3>Attention &ndash; Open is attractive</h3>

<p>Where data is opened in an easily accessible format with some guarantee that the openness will be sustained, it will gather a lot of attention. A captive audience is certainly a valuable asset. The traffic it generates may be more valuable than the data itself. The technical implementation must be thought through carefully if the attention is going to be captured/ channeled through this approach.</p>

<h2>Using Open Data</h2>

<p>There are a variety of ways to profit from open data. The line-between this categories is blurred. The general sequence is from data source to final use. Applications may include one or more steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabling Infrastructural</li>
<li>Information Enrichment</li>
<li>Analysis and Consultancy</li>
<li>Application Development</li>
</ul>


<h3>Enabling Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Although open data ought to be free to access it may not be free to enable that access. There is a cost (and therefore a profit) associated with opening data. A business or a government agency who wishes to open their a data are customers in this regard. Thus there is a business opportunity in supplying services such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information architecture design &ndash; planning out the schema, ontology, or technical implementation details for open data (either as a service or as creation of an open meta-data asset);</li>
<li>Database &ndash; the technology that will hold the data;</li>
<li>Web hosting &ndash; the technology that will open-up access to the data;</li>
<li>Service/ Application layer &ndash; the technology that will make it (re)usable: Linked-open data, indexing services, user interfaces, APIs, integration gateways, data loaders etc (note that I&rsquo;m thinking particularly of just the server-side &lsquo;openning&rsquo; bit here, not client-side applications of open data &ndash; that comes next!);</li>
<li>Advice on Licensing &ndash; the legal framework; and</li>
<li>Business Advice on Strategy &ndash; as per this post!</li>
</ul>


<h3>Information Enrichment</h3>

<p>As we have seen, data is valuable when presented in context as information. There is a value then, in enriching data by adding more data or context. Some ideas for what this might look like are shared below. The general distinction about enrichment I&rsquo;ve made is that it stops short of being analysis (i.e. the output of enrichment is more open data, not conclusions or decisions &ndash; see the following section for that).
Enrichment services might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linking-open data sources (tying a dataset into the semantic web)</li>
<li>Quality assurance &ndash; providing an independent certification or compliance service (must be careful to consider who pays/ scrutinises for the sake of credibility)</li>
<li>Text analysis &ndash; information extraction (entity recognition, annotation)</li>
<li>Cleaning data &ndash; e.g. reconciling duplicates, ensuring consistency, identifying junk data, processing data so that it conforms with an objective standard)</li>
<li>Reformating &ndash; i.e. tranforming data so that it&rsquo;s provided in a more useful (typically machine readable) format e.g. translating pdfs into csv, wrapping a database in an API</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis and Consultancy</h3>

<p>Open data can be a vital input into services designed to provide advice and support to decision makers. Beyond the simple fact that the information is free, there is a value in using a resource that is open because it is verifiable. That is to say, your analysis may be reproduced and checked. Notice that this doesn&rsquo;t actually need to have happened for this to be of benefit, indeed the very possibility may be credible enough.
For the sake of completeness here are some examples of analytical services that might benefit from using open data sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consultancy/ Advice/ Decision support/ Insight</li>
<li>Policy Development/ Advocacy/ Lobbying</li>
<li>Statistical analysis and modelling</li>
<li>Presentation (data graphics/ visualisation, sonification, and interaction)</li>
<li>Scientific, Technical or Operational research (and product or process development)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application Development</h3>

<p>Finally open data can be integrated into applications that provide value to consumers, businesses, government, or indeed other developers. Here open data is interpreted in a particular domain of interest to provide a service.</p>

<h2>Commercial models for Open Data</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen the value of openning data, and of using open data, but how can this value be translated into profit? Here I&rsquo;ll present a few models:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal pricing</li>
<li>cross-subsidy</li>
<li>freemium</li>
<li>advertising</li>
<li>sponsorship</li>
<li>affiliation</li>
</ul>


<h3>Normal pricing</h3>

<p>The most obvious model is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; pricing. This bears stating as it&rsquo;s not always apparent from listening to open data advocates! Just because the data is provided for free, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the services that apply this data must be provided for free. Your ability to charge for something will depend upon how costly it would be for another person (or business) to reproduce the application you&rsquo;ve created.
Traditional pricing models are also part of&hellip;</p>

<h3>Cross-subsidy</h3>

<p>The idea here is that an open data proposition enhances the value of complementary services to the extent that those other services make enough extra profit to pay for the costs of openning the data. Clearly this is easiest where the organisation that decides to open the data is also the one generating profit from the service although it may be possible to design commercial arrangements for a payment between two organisations.
The inherent difficulty with this model is problem of quantifying the contribution of the open data to the complementary service. Since open data is untraded and thus there&rsquo;s no price signal of value. While it may be possible to calculate the total value of network effects captured by a given organisation, it is particularly difficult to put a price on the risk avoidance or reputational benefits.</p>

<h3>Freemium</h3>

<p>Where the service is the provision of data itself it&rsquo;s not possible to follow either of the first two models. As such an alternative is to segment the market &ndash; providing a basic level of &lsquo;free&rsquo; service and a premium level of &lsquo;paid&rsquo; service (essentially a cross-subsidy from the latter to the former). This can operate like a loss-leader. Typically the market is segmented according to the level of access provided (number or range of requests permitted or the speed of response). As the premium services begin to differ systematically from the core open data offering (e.g. training or consultancy) this pricing model begins to ressemble the cross-subsidy archetype.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>This is the most generally-applicable of the pricing models. Where a cross-subsidy cannot be established (perhaps because the difficulty agreeing a contract between the data opener and service vendor) it may be possible to pay for open data via advertising.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>

<p>If your data generates enough attention, people may be willing to pay you to include their content. Naturally this isn&rsquo;t an obvious option for a start-up or un-tested service and it may be inappropriate for some data sets. For example: sponsored links on Twitter, Google Search and Reddit.</p>

<h3>Affiliation</h3>

<p>This is the reverse side of sponsorship where affiliates receive open data for free which they then process and redistribute in order to send attention back up the chain. For example: Amazon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data doesn&rsquo;t make for a very good tradable commodity. Technological changes that allow us to connect and share data more easily are disrupting established business models. Therefore the public sector has a critical role to intervene in the data market and the private sector must adapt to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Market Isn&rsquo;t Always Perfect</h2>

<p>Economists use this term to describe situations where the allocation of goods and services by the free market is inefficient (i.e. someone can be made better off without making another worse off). <strong>In some extreme cases the good or service would not be available without intervention by government</strong>. The market is only effective if the good or service:</p>

<ul>
<li>has a price which reflects all costs and benefits</li>
<li>can be withheld from people at reasonable expense</li>
<li>cannot be used by more than one person at the same time</li>
</ul>


<p>These characteristics don&rsquo;t apply in the case of open data&hellip;</p>

<h2>Open Data: The Gift That Keeps On Giving</h2>

<p>An externality, or spillover effect, is a cost or benefit that is incurred by someone who is not involved in the trade. The price will not reflect these indirect social impacts. Pollution is an example of how external costs can lead to excessive production.</p>

<p><em>Network externalities</em> are a form of external benefit. Within a network the value of an adding an extra node or edge (e.g. person or friendship) is felt by every other part of the network. The Metrolink extension, for example, is not only of benefit to people in the new areas that can now use trams, but also to people in the existing areas that can now access new areas.</p>

<p>Network externalities occur in the case of open data because data is only informative when it is interpreted. The value of each datum increases with the volume of other data that it may be connected with as the context and range of analysis that are possible increases. Thus, data operates as a network. In deciding whether or not to open their data, <strong>private organisations will not consider the indirect benefits that their data will have to improve the quality of every other dataset</strong> and so will release less data than is socially optimal.</p>

<h2>Data As A Public Good</h2>

<p>A <em>public good</em> is one which is non-excludable (impossible to prevent people from using it) and non-rival (one person&rsquo;s use doesn&rsquo;t not reduce availability to another). The problem with these goods is that consumers can take advantage without contributing sufficiently to their creation. If too many people decide to <em>free-ride</em> then the private revenues won&rsquo;t meet the private costs and the incentive to provide the good through the market will disappear.</p>

<p>Data is typically non-excludable. Although legislation may prohibit the buyer from sharing data it is, in many cases, practically unenforcable (as is apparent with music sharing, for example). Data is also non-rival. Your reading of this post does not prevent another person from reading it &ndash; indeed I don&rsquo;t loose the ideas when I write them down &ndash; we can all enjoy them at the same time. <strong>Where data may be characterised as a public good, subject to the free-rider problem, there won&rsquo;t be sufficient private incentives for production and distribution</strong>.</p>

<h2>Implications For Business &amp; Government</h2>

<p>So what does this economic analysis tell us?</p>

<ol>
<li>Technological change (particularly the increasing capacity for connecting and sharing data) will disrupt certain markets by undermining established closed-data business models;</li>
<li>Businesses that attempt to defend outdated business models by keeping data closed won&rsquo;t be able to compete with an open alternatives (alternatives that they are encouraging by keeping their data closed);</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s probably better for such businesses to open their data before a competitor does &ndash; they shouldn&rsquo;t waste their current position of dominance;</li>
<li>In some cases, where the market fails completely, public intervention to fund the creation or provision of information will help to improve economic growth and social welfare;</li>
<li>In other cases there will be considerable <a href="/blog/2013/03/01/open-data-business-models">opportunities for private firms to innovate and capture the benefits of open data</a>.</li>
</ol>
