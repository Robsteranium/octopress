<h3>E-Petitions as an alternative to consultation</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/">e-petitions on Number10.gov</a> are fascinating.&nbsp; As we've come to expect from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/">mySociety projects</a>, &quot;the e-petition system has been designed to be transparent and trustworthy&quot;.&nbsp; The petitions provide an unbiased perspective on the view of the UK public and a <strong>valuable evidence base</strong> for policy makers.</p>
<p>Although the feedback is free from the constraints of normal consultation (where the questions may be&nbsp; framed unintentionally) it is unstructured and this makes it difficult for policy makers to use.&nbsp; Hope is not lost however, help is at hand in the form of <strong>semantic analysis</strong>.</p>
<h3>Extract information from e-petition data with semantic analysis</h3>
<p>The image above was constructed by annotating the text in the titles of the petitions.&nbsp; We searched for verbs and extracted the pruned form of those verbs (e.g. &quot;increasing&quot; becomes &quot;increase&quot;) along with the number of signatures to the petition where the verbs were found.&nbsp; The words are weighted according to the total number of signatures.&nbsp; The visualisation was prepared using IBM's <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Many Eyes</a> (note that data submitted to Many Eyes can be viewed by anyone on the internet).</p>
<p>Annotation can also be used to find organisations and places.&nbsp; The results of those analyses are presented in the lists below.</p>

<h3>Beware of junk data</h3>
<p>Although the openness of e-petitions is a virtue, it does mean that there is a lot of junk to sift through.&nbsp; Only 1.3% of open petitions have enough signatures (at least 200) to qualify for consideration by Government.&nbsp; Clearly the other petitions have some value even though they may be minority concerns.&nbsp; Indeed the number of signatures is not a perfect measure of quality or relevance.</p>
<h3>Using the evidence in policy development</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Keep track of petitions that are made regarding your organisation or place</strong>.&nbsp; We were able to identify 352 references to organisations, 36 of which were Councils.&nbsp; <a href="http://infonomics.ltd.uk/contact">Get in touch</a> for some tips on monitoring the web for references to your organisation.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify issues that are relevant to your objectives</strong>.&nbsp; We recently employed <a href="http://infonomics.ltd.uk/portfolio_project/4">semantic analysis that helped Investor Developers at the East Midlands Development Agency forecast demand for support by extracting information from visit reports</a>.&nbsp; Petitions provide evidence of needs (or at least demands) and issues (learn from others mistakes).</li>
    <li><strong>Gauge public opinions on existing policy</strong>.&nbsp; Congestion-charging, War, Bank-bailouts - they're all subjects of petitions.&nbsp; While many of the petitions express peoples' feelings on these issues there are others that contain concrete suggestions for policy improvements.</li>
</ul>
