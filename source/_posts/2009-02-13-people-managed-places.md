<p><a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1748140">People-managed Place</a> is an idea introduced by Robin Gower in an article published by the Journal of Place Management and Development.</p>
<p>The &quot;place management problem&quot; arises because:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Together we are stronger (or, that cooperative outcomes often beat competitive ones)</strong>: the tragedy of the commons and existence of social externalities in our environment;</li>
    <li><strong>Diverse communities don't tend to share places very well</strong>: non-cooperative game theory suggests that we won't share spontaneously;</li>
    <li><strong>Active place management is inherently difficult</strong>: because of the complexity involved Planners are at risk of becoming part of the problem!</li>
</ul>

<p>The article warns that if opt to &quot;do-nothing&quot; then we face the <strong>risk of inaction &ndash; standardised places</strong> where developers and national retail chains unwittingly reduce our metropolitan areas to a network of <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/clonetownbritainnewsthefightback200306.aspx">clone-towns</a>.&nbsp; The proposed range of solutions are <strong>bottom-up rather than top-down</strong> and focus on <strong>users not functions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inter-dependence through trade</strong> (the butcher needs the baker and vice versa)</li>
    <li><strong>Agglomeration Economies &amp; Business Clusters</strong> (industrial communities)</li>
    <li>the <strong>Sidewalk Ballet</strong> (the eyes of fellow pedestrians make streets safer than CCTV cameras)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these examples demonstrates that place management ought not attempt to zone and plan but to empower individuals and let places evolve organically.&nbsp;  Place managers can deal with the complex socio-economic problems of place by facilitating and regulating a stronger civil society.&nbsp;  The article refers to the similar advice suggested by other authors (such as the <a href="http://www.ceu-ectp.org/e/athens/">New Athens Charter</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Intelligent_Urbanism">principles of intelligent urbanism</a> and Camilo Sitte's belief that plazas and squares are civic rooms that ought to be left open) and provides a brief summary of the relevant UK legislation. &nbsp; The analysis leads me to make the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start with current place users</strong>: i.e. not place functions</li>
    <li><strong>Consider potential place users</strong>: to ensure dynamic sustainability</li>
    <li><strong>Define place-based rights &amp; responsibilities</strong>: to protect place uses (e.g. <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/CrimePrevention/DG_4001652">Anti-Social Behaviour Orders</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading">tradeable pollution permits</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Encourage collaboration</strong>: through, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_improvement_district">Business Improvement Districts</a></li>
    <li><strong>Cross boundaries and work with your neighbours</strong>: zero-sum games are the bane of place-management policy - use partnerships to communicate and negotiate</li>
    <li><strong>Place Making/ Leadership - internalise externalities</strong>: place-manager must make place-users aware of the social costs and benefits (publicise planning gains and declare what supplementary business rates are spent on).</li>
</ul>
<p class="rteleft">Michael Heller has coined a phrase that describes the problem of multiple and complex claims on a common resource: The Tragedy of the Anti-Commons.&nbsp;  In the video below Professor Heller discusses his book, <a href="http://www.gridlockeconomy.com/">The Gridlock Economy</a>.</p>
