<p>R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. &nbsp;At Infonomics we use R to handle much of our analytic work, particularly where there is repeated processing of data, complex statistical models, or requirements for data graphics that go beyond the limitations of spreadsheets. &nbsp;We've used it, for example, in the&nbsp;<a href="http://reports.infonomics.ltd.uk/">AutoReporter</a>.</p>
<p>The talk will provide: an introduction to R, discussion of when (and when not) to use R, and a guided tour of it's capabilities with examples. &nbsp;It's also a chance to learn about the secrets of some of our tools of the trade. We expect that audience will comprise those with a interest in data/ statistics, software and/ or visualisation.</p>
<p><a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Manchester">Manchester Free Software</a>&nbsp;was formed in response to the growing need for a group based in the Manchester area that focuses on Free Software and GNU/Linux primarily, but also on issues such as Digital Restrictions Management and other issues which infringe on the freedoms of computer users.</p>
