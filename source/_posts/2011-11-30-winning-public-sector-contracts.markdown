I was invited to provide some training at the <a href="http://www.socialsolutionsacademy.co.uk/"><acronym title="Social Solutions Academy">SSA</acronym></a>'s <a href="http://www.socialsolutionsacademy.co.uk/past-events/">Social Enterprise Action Day</a>.

One of the participants was kind enough to say:

The 'Winning public contracts' session very good, I was very impressed with content. The facilitator had undertaken some research about my social enterprise prior to the event and found a relevant funding opportunity. This was used as a case study during the session.
