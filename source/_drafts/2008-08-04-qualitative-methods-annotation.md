</b></span>In response to client requests for qualitative methods we've developed a range of tools that we will share with you over the coming months.&nbsp; We hope that you're interested in using these approaches in your projects.<br id="ahsz" />
Qualitative data is typically provided as passages of semi-structured text.&nbsp; That text can be researched and analysed, qualitatively and quantitatively.&nbsp; The matrix below lists possible techniques for each approach.<span id="yaso"><span id="s0sa"><br />

<p><b id="x8gx0">What is Annotation?</b><br id="x8gx1" />
You're probably very familiar with annotation.&nbsp; You do it when you read reports/ publications and make notes in the margins, highlight sentences, or stick bookmarks to the pages.&nbsp; Annotation is the process of &quot;marking-up&quot; a document according to some structure so that you have a guide for when you return to the text.&nbsp; Annotation then, is fundamental to information extraction and retrieval.&nbsp; Annotations locate text and describe why that text is of interest.&nbsp; Annotations are a type of meta-data - i.e. data about data.</p>
<p>Annotation can be performed automatically by a computer.&nbsp; The software needs to know what you're looking for and why (i.e. how to mark-up the text that it finds).</p>
<p><b>Uses of Annotation</b><br />
Annotation brings structure to unstructured text.&nbsp; It allows us to:<span class="inline inline-right"><a href="/?q=node/33"><img width="185" hspace="5" height="100" align="right" src="/files/images/annic.preview.png" alt="Extracting Annotated Text in Context" title="Extracting Annotated Text in Context" class="image image-thumbnail" /></a></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Extract data by theme</i>.&nbsp; If you want to review a body of literature to identify all passages that refer to, for example, enterprise strategy, then you can simply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>annotate the corpus using a keyword list (e.g. enterprise, start-up, business, entrepreneur etc);</li>
    <li>extract those annotations in context (i.e. to see the keyword and 15 words either side);</li>
    <li>read through the extracted excerpts and only refer back to the source documents if and when more depth is needed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><i>Analysis of content</i>.&nbsp; You can summarise documents by analysing their contents.&nbsp; Two interesting aspects that annotations help to analyse are word frequencies and co-located words.&nbsp; Word frequency may indicate relevance (e.g. a given document mentions &quot;productivity&quot; more times than another) whereas co-located words provide more insight into meaning (e.g. &quot;productivity&quot; tends to be mentioned along side &quot;growth&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example of Annotation</b></p>
<p>We've recently used annotation to help the East Midlands Development Agency to interpret a body of 700+ visit reports in terms of two dozen key issues.&nbsp; We used annotation to speed-up the process of extracting relevant excerpts from the report narrative.</p>
<p>We're also researching the potential for using correlations in co-locations as an indicator of memetic convergence.&nbsp; In other words, we're comparing policy documents to quantify the consensus of ideas.&nbsp; We expect that this research will produce a methodology for quantifying Strategic Added Value (as described in the Impact Evaluation Framework for Regional Development Agencies).&nbsp; Our initial findings are intuitively plausible: that Regional Economic Strategies in each region are roughly &quot;half similar&quot;, and that neighbouring agencies tend to have more in common that distant ones.</p>
