<p>We've already covered extraction (which we called <a href="../../../../?q=node/31">Reverse Mail Merge</a>) and processing (<a href="../../../../?q=node/32">Annotation</a>).&nbsp; Below we discuss statistical analysis.&nbsp; Next time we'll cover graphical presentation.</p>
<p><b id="x8gx0">What is a binary choice?</b></p>
<p>Qualitative data does not lend itself to quantitative analysis.&nbsp; The source data is not standardised and so it is difficult to summarise (count, average or compare).&nbsp; Typically open-ended responses are reviewed manually and the odd quote is selected to corroborate or contextualise quantitative findings.&nbsp; The discretionary selection of individual comments risks leaving a wealth of information behind.</p>
<p>One method of quantifying the qualitative is to classify data in terms of binary choices (true vs false) effectively re-colouring shades of grey into a black vs. white contrast.&nbsp; The classified data may then be aggregated for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>It is also possible to classify data in terms of discrete choices across a range of more than 2 options (e.g. a Likert scale of 1 to 5) although we shall focus on binary choices.</p>
<p><b>How to cast data into binary choices</b></p>
<p>Classification of qualitative data may be performed at the time of data collection or retrospectively.</p>
<p>A well designed questionnaire will combine open and closed questions and provide rich detail and classified responses.&nbsp; In these cases the interviewer can ask for top-of-mind responses (&quot;what do you think of ... ?&quot;) and then probe further to qualify the response into binary choices (&quot;would you agree that ... ?&quot;).&nbsp; There are problems however:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The use of such questionnaires requires that the interviewer has good interpretive skills (that save respondent from the pain of repeating answers and listening through irrelevant options).</li>
    <li>These questionnaire may also have complicated routing systems that may discourage an unaided respondent (e.g. a web or postal respondent) from completing the survey.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, well designed questionnaires require foresight as to the possible options that will be captured in the qualifying questions: i.e. the designer must know in advance what the binary choices will be.&nbsp; Such foresight may be undesirable (as it may introduce bias to otherwise open-ended questions &quot;what are your opinions of...&quot; becomes &quot;do you agree that... ?&quot;) or even impossible (&quot;do you have any other comments about ... ?&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospective classification side-steps the need to embed binary choices in the data collection process and, in so doing, bypasses the problems listed above.&nbsp; Retrospective analysis may also unlock the potential of information stored in old datasets.&nbsp; One way of acheiving this is simply to employ reviewers to manually sift through the text.&nbsp; This is labour intensive and subjective (although having several reviewers covering each response can help to acheive an 'inter-subjective' balance).&nbsp; A more attractive way of classifying results is to use an automated process.&nbsp; Here <a href="../../../../?q=node/32">annotation</a> comes into it's own as a means of isolating passages of text that deal with the binary choice in question, highlighting evidence that the subject is for/ against the proposition, and, in more advanced applications, extracting the respondent's answer.</p>
<p><b>Statistical Analysis of Binary Choices<br />
</b></p>
<p>Binary choice data is amenable standard statistical techniques.&nbsp; The decision to choose either alternative is typically characterised as the probability e.g. of the respondent agreeing with a qualitative statement; the data is cross-tabulated into segments, calculating the proportion of &quot;yeses&quot; from each sub-group. Binary data can also be analysed in it's discrete format, calculating the total number of &quot;yeses&quot;.</p>
<p>The analysis may include significance testing an estimate of the proportion of respondents who agree with a given statement.&nbsp; Other - non-qualitative/ non-binary-choice - variables may be introduced: the analysis may involve inference testing comparisons drawn between two segments of the sample dataset (e.g. are wealthier people more likely to agree?).</p>
<p>More advanced techniques might include analysis of uni- and multi-variate correlations to investigate relationships and patterns in the data.&nbsp; This approach allows us to introduce continuous variables into the analysis (e.g. how much does an additional &pound;1,000 of income affect people's probability of agreeing?).</p>
<p>These sorts of regressions are appealing because they are simple to interpret.&nbsp; The below example plots a model of the incidence of planning issues among investors (a binary choice: issue or no issue) against the output (GVA as a percentage of it's 2000 level) and stock prices (FTSE 100 in pence) over the period 2004-2008.&nbsp; The model correctly predicted the consequences of the economic downturn: that falling output and stock prices would be associated with a reduction in the number of planning applications made (and therefore issues faced) by investors.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><span class="inline inline-center"><span class="caption"><strong>Investors are less likely to report planning issues during an economic downturn<br />
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Simple regressions don't always suit binary choice data.&nbsp; In particular linear regressions (as above):</p>
<ul>
    <li>can (erroneously) predict impossible values (i.e. that the binary choice may be negative or greater than 100%) and</li>
    <li>only allow for constant returns, whereas we would expect diminishing returns to apply (i.e. with an income of more than &pound;30,000, the additional &pound;1,000 has less affect than for those earning &pound;15,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to respond to these problems, a different functional form is required.&nbsp; A common response is to use a logarithmic model.&nbsp; A logit model constrains the predicted values in the range 0-1 and implies diminishing returns as we approach the limits of this range.</p>
<p>As with any econometric regression, finding the optimal model is as much a technical problem an artistic expression!&nbsp; The chosen model(s) will probably involve a collection of the above techniques and even combinations (interaction terms).</p>
<p><b>Why use binary choice statistics?</b></p>
<p>In summary, the techniques described above offer the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>relax requirements for skilled interviewers - <b>reducing costs in data collection</b></li>
    <li><b>obviate the need for perfect foresight</b> when planning questionnaires</li>
    <li>relax requirements for interpretation - <b>reducing costs in data processing</b>/ analysis</li>
    <li>provide models with <b>practical insights about behaviour and choices</b> - e.g. demand forecasts &quot;an x% drop in the FTSE will lead to y% fewer planning enquires&quot;, cost estimates &quot;residents in area x are y% poorer and therefore z% less likely to use the service&quot;</li>
</ul>
