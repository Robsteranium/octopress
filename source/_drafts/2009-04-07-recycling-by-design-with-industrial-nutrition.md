<h3>What is industrial nutrition?</h3>
<p>The balance between economy and environment has recently been cast in very negative terms. The language of climate change compels us to &quot;reduce our carbon footprint&quot;, lead &quot;low impact lives&quot;, and protect the environment.</p>
<p>Clearly this is only one part of the story. There are also examples of a <strong>positive relationship between economy and environment</strong>. Tradable pollution permits, for example, create incentives for private industry to invest in and develop technology to protect the environmental. The development of a green infrastructure will be vital ingredient in the recipe for economic recovery

<p>The video below provides another viewpoint. The film's producers (Christopher Bronsart and Daniel Migg) realise that recycling is too often an after-thought, a process applied to materials that were never meant to be re-used.&nbsp;  Instead they suggest that we <strong>design products to be nutrition for industry</strong>, in the same way that, for example, nitrogen is recycled in nature through decomposition.</p>

<h3>How does it work in practice?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Industrial nutrition can be as simple as including schematic diagrams with products, or labeling circuit board to allow for future maintenance and customisation.</li>
    <li>The main export from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.shipcanal.co.uk/port-of-liverpool/">Port of Liverpool</a> is scrap metal for recycling.</li>
    <li>In the UK, used plastic bottles are melted-down and reformed (or sent to landfill).&nbsp; In other countries, slightly thicker bottles are produced allowing for cleaning and re-use of the product rather than recycling of the resources.</li>
    <li>There are a range of <a rel="nofollow" href="recycling http://www.mobilephonerecycling.co.uk/">mobile phone recycling companies</a> offering to buy your old phone.</li>
    <li>Modular design allows a product's components to be re-configured for different purposes</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11482589">Open source hardware</a> development goes beyond the sharing of schematics, to share the blue prints of the product. &nbsp; The <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino circuit board</a>, for example, has nourished a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Projects/ArduinoUsers">wide range of projects</a> (a Laser Harp, Plants that ask to be watered, and Karaoke Breathalyser Microphones).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why isn't this common?&nbsp; What's wrong with our technical metabolism?</h3>
<p>An obvious question is: if the potential of industrial nutrition is so great, why isn't it commonplace?&nbsp; The points below explain why the economic reality of industrial nutrition doesn't live up to the environmental dream; in other words why the market fails.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nutrition is, by definition, an externality - a factor that a firm does not take into account when deciding what to produce - the future of expired products is somebody else's problem. <strong> The price of products only reflects the cost of production, not the total cost of production and disposal</strong>.</li>
    <li>Although consumers may consider the second-hand value of the products they buy, this usually only applies to completed products (cars, appliances etc).&nbsp;  The consumer has too little technical knowledge to disassemble and sell individual components of their old products.&nbsp;  <strong>We act as if obsolete products have no value</strong>.&nbsp;  This is plainly incorrect, there is a value to both the manufacturing work completed and the resources contained within.&nbsp;   Furthermore dumping them in landfill comes at a cost to the planet (this cost is external to the decisions of consumers).&nbsp; From the consumer's perspective, the individual components are simply worth too little by comparison with the cost of selling them.</li>
    <li>The direct profits from industrial nutrition accrue to the entrepreneurs who sell new products made of old resources. &nbsp; The inputs to this process may be spread across a wide range of sources.&nbsp;  <strong>Part of the problem is the difficulty such entrepreneurs face in coordinating and sourcing industrial nutrition</strong> (fragmentation causes problems in <a href="http://clients.infonomics.ltd.uk/?q=peoplemanagedplaces">place regeneration</a> too).</li>
</ul>
<h3>So what can policy makers do to solve these market failures, to encourage industrial nutrition?</h3>
<p>The problems are interconnected.&nbsp;  If consumers are made to account for the true cost (internalising the externality if you will) then they will be more likely to ensure that they dispose of their products in a sustainable manner, and thus producers will be more likely to design and build products that can be re-used/ recycled more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Legislation</strong> can help to make manufactured goods' prices reflect their environmental costs. &nbsp; Plastic bottles are re-used abroad because, unlike in the UK, foreign laws require that consumers pay a deposit when buying plastic bottles that is redeemed when the empty container is returned for recycling.&nbsp;  The <acronym title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</acronym> directive, landfill tax, and emissions trading are examples of legislation that will &quot;internalise the externalities&quot; and encourage industrial nutrition.&nbsp; Development of cluster initiatives and industrial standards will help to embed the philosophy.</p>
<p>Learning to maintain and repair your capital assets - your appliances, home or car - isn't just good sense, as a social norm this prudence will encourage manufacturers to build sustainable products.&nbsp; <strong>Social Norms</strong> such as the will to reuse and recycle encourage us to act in the knowledge of our impact upon others in our environment.</p>
