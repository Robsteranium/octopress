</b></span>In response to client requests for qualitative methods we've developed a range of tools that we will share with you over the coming months.&nbsp; We hope that you're interested in using these approaches in your projects.<br id="ahsz" />
Qualitative data is typically provided as passages of semi-structured text.&nbsp; That text can be researched and analysed, qualitatively and quantitatively.&nbsp; The matrix below lists possible techniques for each approach.<span id="yaso"><span id="s0sa"><br />

<p>This unlikely title has been chosen to describe those occasions when you have text (e.g. in a Word Document) that you want to extract, field by field, record by record, into a table (e.g. an Excel Spreadsheet) - like a mail merge but in reverse<sup id="pjur">1</sup>.<br id="tpnd" />
In an ideal world text extraction of this nature would be unnecessary because the data would already be fully structured with forms that describe the fields and records<sup id="qsqq">2</sup>.&nbsp; In reality the data we work with has not been prepared for analysis.<br id="l-pj" />
The typical scenario for this tool would include occasions where you have a large body of documents that you want to read, and an associated excel template that you want to populate.&nbsp; The documents should be semi-structured as the tool uses the consistent elements of formatting or styles to find the data to extract (un-structured text will be covered in a later bulletin on Annotation).&nbsp; Examples include:</p>
<ul id="onre">
    <li>proformas/ templates</li>
    <li id="t6n.">application forms</li>
    <li id="abcr">visit reports</li>
    <li id="x94c">web pages (e.g. search results that aren't provided as a table for download)</li>
    <li id="mm40">reports and proposals (e.g. to gather a document index for ISO version/ quality management).</li>
</ul>
<p>An extraction algorithm - that works like a glorified find and replace - is prepared to suit the document structure.&nbsp; The program will then scan thousands of documents in a matter of seconds and provide a tables of results.<br />
Although very small, one-off, requirements would not justify the time required to prepare the algorithm, economies of scale are soon apparent even with short tasks like extracting names and addresses from a dozen files.<br id="q4td" />

<b id="q4td1">Using reverse mail merge in your projects</b><br id="q4td2" />
This bulletin provides a brief introduction to one tool for the quantitative research of qualitative data.<br id="ikkb" />
Clearly this approach has the potential to offer you a massive saving on the resources required to read and extract data from documents, allowing you to focus on the higher-value added, and frankly more exciting, parts of the job.<br id="aekh" />
Please get in touch if you want to know more about the technique (or about normal mail merge or forms) or would like to see a demonstration.<br id="qvpc" />
